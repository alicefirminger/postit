# POST IT

Welcome to POST IT. A post-it style blog application created in HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

Submit a blog post via the form and see each post displayed on a colourful square.

This is a work in progress. I am currently implementing a backend using express.js and the aim is to be able to store, edit and delete posts that are made.
